I am a third year Computer Science PhD student in the ACO program at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by [Anupam Gupta](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anupamg/). I received my B.Tech. in Computer Science from Indian institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science. I mainly work on Approximation Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization.

In my free time, I contemplate existence or watch movies and anime.
